AcidWatch is a tool designed to empower researchers, chemists, and industry
professionals by providing a single interface to access many models, each
capable of calculating and/or predicting chemical reactions involving impurities
in CO2 streams.

Our goal is to democratize and open up the discussion around CO2 impurities,
fostering collaboration and innovation in the field.

AcidWatch is opensource and can be found at: AcidWatch. It is still under
development and will change continuously going forward. The models themselves
are also continuously developed and will be at different maturity level
independently. Please use the results with caution.
