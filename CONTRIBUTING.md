# Contributing

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to AcidWatch.

## Ground Rules

We use `prettier` as our code formatter. Format all of your code prior to commiting. There is a GitHub workflow with the check that must be successful in order for you to be able to merge a pull request to `main` branch.

## Commits

We strive to keep a consistent and clean git history in the `main` branch and all contributions should adhere to the following:

1. The commit message should be descriptive.
2. Ideally, a commit should do one atomic change on the repository. 
3. All the changes should be accounted for and not go "implicitly".


We expect commit messages to follow this style:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Keep the subject line short and informative 
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
1. Use the body to explain what and why instead of how

This list is inspired by [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## Pull Request 

Every commit in the `main` branch should be added through a pull request.
Ideally a pull request will be small in scope and atomic.
If you are fixing a minor detail in addition to the scope of your PR (formatting, linting, moving, simple refactoring ...), please make sure that this results in a separate commit.

If you find that you want to do lots of changes that are not directly related
to the issue you're working on, create a separate PR.

### We thank you for your interest in AcidWatch and for your contributions!
