# AcidWatch

Welcome to the **AcidWatch** repository.

This repository is dedicated to the development of a common frontend for tools aimed at calculating and predicting chemical reactions occurring within CO<sub>2</sub> streams. Our goal is to democritise and open up the discussion around CO<sub>2</sub> impurities and to provide a reliable resource for researchers, chemists, and industry professionals interested in understanding and controlling the behavior of CO<sub>2</sub> impurities.

## Links to Access AcidWatch in the Browser

AcidWatch is accessible at https://acidwatch.radix.equinor.com/, which is the official link to the latest stable version of the platform. Additionally, mainly for development purposes, we maintain three environments:

- **Development**: The latest features in active development (may be unstable). Access the dev version [here](https://frontend-acidwatch-dev.radix.equinor.com/).
- **Testing**: For testing new features (more stable than dev). Access the test version [here](https://frontend-acidwatch-test.radix.equinor.com/).
- **Production**: The official live platform with all tested and stable features. Access the production version [here](https://frontend-acidwatch-prod.radix.equinor.com/). The main URL (https://acidwatch.radix.equinor.com/) also directs to the production environment.

Please note: You might need appropriate permissions to access the environments.

## Coming Soon

- React frontend
- Prediction models for CO2 impurities interactions (for example, based on [ARCS](https://github.com/equinor/arcs))
- Documentation and user guides

Thank you for your interest in **acidwatch**. Stay tuned for updates and progress on the tool!
