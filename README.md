# acidwatch

Welcome to the **acidwatch** repository.

This repository is dedicated to the development of a tool aimed at calculating and predicting chemical reactions occurring within CO<sub>2</sub> streams. Our goal is to democritise and open up the discussion around CO<sub>2</sub> impurities and to provide a reliable resource for researchers, chemists, and industry professionals interested in understanding and controlling the behavior of CO<sub>2</sub> impurities.

## Coming Soon
- React frontend
- Prediction models for CO2 impurities interactions (for example, based on [ARCS](https://github.com/equinor/arcs))
- Documentation and user guides

Thank you for your interest in **acidwatch**. Stay tuned for updates and progress on the tool!
